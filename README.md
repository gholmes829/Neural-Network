# Neural-Network
Neural network with backpropogation implemented completely from scratch in Python using NumPy! Check out the following heat map depicting the decision boundary resulting from training my neural network on the nonlinear XOR problem. Note that the output rounds to z=0 at (x, y) = (0, 0) and (1, 1) while it rounds to z=1 at (x, y) = (1, 0) and (0, 1), just as it should:
